I can see you have a basic test structure in place with some tests for MainProcessor, but the test suite needs to be expanded and completed. I'll analyze your existing test file and the project structure to create comprehensive unit tests that cover all the functionality. I need to examine the main InteractivePlot module to understand all the components that need testing, then create proper fixtures for test data, add missing test cases for edge cases and error handling, and ensure all tests are properly structured with appropriate assertions. I'll also make sure the tests are runnable and follow pytest best practices with proper setup and teardown.

I need to examine the conftest.py file to understand the existing fixtures and see what test data is already set up.

**Initiating Test Construction**

I'm starting by digging into the `tests` folder. I'm examining the existing test files to grasp the current setup and pinpoint gaps. The aim is to build comprehensive, runnable tests and unit tests, as requested.


**Inspecting Test Files**

I've reviewed the `test_config_layer.py`, `test_main.py`, and `test_persistence_layer .py` files now. I'm mapping the existing coverage and starting to see where the gaps are. My focus is the `MainProcessor` class and its associated functions, aiming to write tests for its core methods first. The goal is to build robust tests.

I will start by examining the existing test files in the tests folder to understand the current test coverage and identify areas for improvement. I'll begin with test_config_layer.py , test_main.py , and test_persistence_layer.py .

I will modify conftest.py to add new fixtures for allsensor_json_config , persensor_json_config , and paired_json_config , along with corresponding temporary files. These fixtures will provide the necessary test data for the different JSON parser types.

Review

I will update test_config_layer.py to include more comprehensive tests for the JSONParserFactory . This involves adding tests for each type of JSON parser ( AllsensorJSONParser , PersensorJSONParser , PairedJSONParser ) using the new fixtures, and a test for invalid HDF file types.

Review

I will update test_main.py to use the correct MainProcessor from ResimHTMLReport.py instead of InteractivePlot.main . I'll also adjust the tests to reflect the actual behavior of the MainProcessor , including how it handles file parsing and processing.

Review

I will update test_persistence_layer.py to include more comprehensive tests for the HdfProcessorFactory . This involves testing the factory's behavior with different HDF file types and ensuring that the process method executes without errors. I'll also add more specific assertions for HDF file content.

Review

I will create a new test file test_data_storage.py to house unit tests for the c_data_storage module. This will include tests for DataModelStorage and RegexStorage if it's used, focusing on their core functionalities like data loading, storage, and retrieval.

Review

I will create test_business_layer.py to test the components in d_business_layer . This will include tests for DataPrep and DataCal , focusing on their data transformation and calculation logic. I'll need to define appropriate fixtures or mock data for these tests.

Review

I will create test_presentation_layer.py to test the components in e_presentation_layer . This will include tests for HTMLGenerator and PlotlyVisualization , focusing on their output generation (HTML structure, plot configurations). I'll use mocks for external dependencies like Plotly if direct plotting is too complex or slow for unit tests.

Review

I need to inspect the actual implementation of DataPrep , DataCal , HTMLGenerator , and PlotlyVisualization to write more specific and meaningful unit tests for them. I'll start by viewing these files.

InteractivePlot\d_business_layer\data_prep.py :( 1 - 200 )

InteractivePlot\d_business_layer\data_cal.py :( 1 - 200 )

InteractivePlot\e_presentation_layer\html_generator.py :( 1 - 200 )

InteractivePlot\e_presentation_layer\plotly_visualization.py :( 1 - 200 )

I will update test_business_layer.py to add specific tests for the DataCalculations class. This includes testing methods like scatter_plot , scatter_plot_mstokmh , and scatter_with_mismatch by mocking PlotlyCharts and verifying that it's called with the correct arguments.

tests\test_business_layer.py

Failed

The previous attempt to update test_business_layer.py failed due to a mismatch in the expected import statement. I need to view the file to ensure the old_str for the import is correct before attempting the update again.

tests\test_business_layer.py :( 1 - 50 )

I have reviewed the file content and it appears the import statement from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock was not present in the file, which caused the previous error. I will add the necessary import statement at the top of the file and then proceed with the rest of the changes to test_business_layer.py to add specific tests for the DataCalculations class.

Review

I will now update test_presentation_layer.py to include more comprehensive tests for HTMLGenerator and PlotlyVisualization . This will involve adding fixtures for HtmlGenerator and PlotlyCharts , and then writing tests to verify the initialization, plot generation, and HTML report generation functionalities.

The previous attempt to update test_presentation_layer.py failed again due to content mismatch. I need to view the file to ensure the old_str values are correct before attempting the update again.

I have reviewed the content of test_presentation_layer.py . The existing structure is quite different from what I was attempting to write. I will now adapt my changes to fit the existing structure, focusing on replacing the placeholder tests with more concrete implementations for HTMLGenerator and PlotlyVisualization (which seems to be the intended name for PlotlyCharts in this file).

Review

Now that the tests for DataCalculations and the presentation layer are improved, I will update test_business_layer.py again to add tests for the DataPrep class. This will involve mocking its dependencies, such as DataModelStorage and DataCalculations , and verifying that DataPrep processes data correctly and interacts with its collaborators as expected.

Review

I've completed writing and enhancing the unit tests for your project. Here's a summary of the work done:

- New Test Files Created :
  
  - `test_data_storage.py` : Added tests for the DataModelStorage class in the c_data_storage module, covering initialization, data addition, retrieval, and metadata handling.
  - `test_business_layer.py` : Initially created with placeholder tests, then significantly updated to include comprehensive tests for DataPrep and DataCalculations classes. This involved mocking dependencies like DataModelStorage , DataCal (for DataPrep ), and PlotlyCharts (for DataCal ), and testing various methods including data processing, plot generation logic, unit conversion, and mismatch detection.
  - `test_presentation_layer.py` : Initially created with placeholder tests, then updated to include detailed tests for HtmlGenerator and PlotlyCharts (referred to as PlotlyVisualization in the initial test file structure). Tests cover initialization, HTML report generation with mock plots, and direct testing of plot creation methods in PlotlyCharts .
- Existing Test Files Enhanced :
  
  - `conftest.py` : Added new fixtures for different JSON parser types ( allsensor_json_config , persensor_json_config , paired_json_config ) and corresponding temporary file fixtures to support more granular testing of JSON configurations.
  - `test_config_layer.py` : Replaced a single JSONParserFactory test with four specialized tests to cover each HDF type ( HDF_WITH_ALLSENSOR , HDF_PER_SENSOR , HDF_PAIRED_FILES ) and invalid type handling, utilizing the new fixtures from conftest.py .
  - `test_main.py` : Updated MainProcessor import, enhanced initialization tests, added tests for successful runs with different JSON configurations, improved output directory handling and cleanup, and created more specific tests for missing XML/JSON file scenarios.
  - `test_persistence_layer.py` : Enhanced HdfProcessorFactory tests with parameterization for all HDF file types, added invalid HDF type handling, improved HDF file reading tests with more assertions, and managed temporary HDF file creation based on JSON configurations.
The test suite now provides more robust coverage across all layers of your application. Remember to adapt and expand these tests as your project evolves.
