The radar visualization depicts a dynamic traffic scenario involving a white ego vehicle (the observer) tracking green moving targets (vehicles or trucks) and red static obstacles (guardrails or pedestrians). The time-based evolution of the scene reveals a complex interaction between the ego vehicle and its environment.
