Gen7v2_Resim_KPI_Scripts
Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment folder "venv" within the "gen7v2_resim_kpi_scripts" repo

Python Version
Base: python 3.12

Packages
Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" from within the virtual environment.

Prerequisite
The input csvs and output csvs should be placed in a folder. The output csvs should be from the same version of RESIM.
Expected input file name is xx_xx_<RADAR_POSITION>xx_xx.csv. E.g. Gen7v2_sw_6_0_101_logs_00002_20250410135804_1_ORCAS_FC_UDP_GEN7_DET_CORE.csv Expected output(RESIM) file name is xx_xx_r00XXYYZZ<RADAR_POSITION>_xx_xx.csv. E.g. Gen7v2_sw_6_0_101_logs_00002_20250410135804_1_ORCAS_r00060003_FC_UDP_GEN7_DET_CORE.csv

Command to run the scripts
<script.py> log_path.txt meta_data.json <output_path> \

<script.py> could be one of the detection/alignment/tracker matching scripts
log_path.txt: user should provide the folder path where the input and output csvs are present
meta_data.json: user can modify the information accordingly
SiL_Engine - SiL Engine version
SW - embedded SW version
RSP_SiL - RSP SiL version
Tracker - Tracker version
Mode - RESIM mode
Max_CDC_Records - Maximum number of CDC records
Range_Saturation_Thresh_Front_Radar - Range saturation threshold for front radar
Range_Saturation_Thresh_Corner_Radar - Range saturation threshold for corner radar
<output_path>: folder path where the user wants the KPI results to be generated
E.g. detection_matching_kpi_script.py log_path.txt meta_data.json C:\Project\Logs\Gen7\v2\WupVeh_Gen7V2_R6.0.3_04042025

Workflow
For KPI matching, in all modes, only below scans will be considered

Scan indices which are non-zero
Scans with non-zero AF detections
Scans with non-zero RDD1 detections
Scans present in both AF stream and RDD stream
Scans present in both vehicle log and ressimmed log
Additionally, in CDC mode:
Scans without CDC saturation(i.e. number of CDC records < 5016)
For KPI yield:

All scans of AF stream is considered as scans available in vehicle
Only those scans which are not CDC saturated, present in AF and RDD streams of both vehicle and resim streams is considered as scans available in simmulation
For Mileage yield:

All scans of VSE stream is considered as scans available in vehicle
Only those scans which are not CDC saturated, present in AF, RDD and VSE streams of both vehicle and resim streams is considered as scans available in simmulation
