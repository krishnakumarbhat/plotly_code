# Interactive Plot Refactoring Plan

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Current Issue**: Classes like `DataPrep`, `HdfProcessorFactory`, and parsers have multiple responsibilities (file I/O, data processing, HTML generation)
- **Solution**:
  - Create separate classes for file operations
  - Move HTML generation logic completely out of data processing classes
  - Separate data reading, processing, and visualization into distinct classes

### 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Current Issue**: Code often requires modification when adding new HDF types or sensors
- **Solution**:
  - Create proper abstractions for parsers with a well-defined interface
  - Implement a plugin system for different file formats and sensor types
  - Use strategy pattern for different visualization techniques

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Current Issue**: Inheritance hierarchy is not always properly followed (e.g., AllsensorHdfParser extends PersensorHdfParser but overrides behavior)
- **Solution**:
  - Create proper abstraction layer with interfaces
  - Ensure child classes can be used interchangeably with parent classes
  - Use composition over inheritance where appropriate

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Current Issue**: Some classes use more methods than needed from their dependencies
- **Solution**:
  - Create smaller, more specific interfaces
  - Implement role-based interfaces for different parsing strategies
  - Define reader, processor, and presenter interfaces

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Current Issue**: High-level modules depend on low-level modules directly
- **Solution**:
  - Introduce interfaces for file parsers, processors, and visualization
  - Use dependency injection for configuration and storage modules
  - Create a service locator or dependency injection container

## Design Patterns to Implement

### 1. Factory Method & Abstract Factory
- Create dedicated factory classes for parsers, processors, and visualizers
- Implement a sensor factory to handle different sensor types

### 2. Strategy Pattern
- Implement different processing strategies for various HDF formats
- Create visualization strategies for different types of plots

### 3. Builder Pattern
- HTML report creation using a builder pattern
- Visualization configuration using builders

### 4. Observer Pattern
- Implement progress reporting through observers
- Create a progress notification system

### 5. Command Pattern
- Processing pipeline as a series of commands
- Allow for undoing or reverting changes if needed

### 6. Facade Pattern
- Create a simplified API for the complex processing system
- Implement a processing facade for easier client usage

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Multiprocessing Implementation
- **File Processing**: Process multiple HDF files in parallel
- **Sensor Processing**: Process different sensors simultaneously
- **HTML Generation**: Generate HTML reports in parallel

### 2. Lazy Loading
- Load HDF data on demand rather than all at once
- Implement lazy visualization rendering

### 3. Caching Strategy
- Cache processed data for reuse
- Implement memoization for expensive calculations

### 4. Optimized Data Structures
- Replace inefficient data structures with appropriate ones
- Use specialized numpy operations for data manipulation

### 5. Asynchronous Processing
- Implement async I/O for file operations
- Use threading for UI updates while processing continues

## Refactoring Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Restructuring Core Components
1. Define interfaces for all major components
2. Implement Factory Method pattern for parsers and processors
3. Separate file I/O from data processing logic

### Phase 2: Implementing SOLID Principles
1. Refactor existing classes to follow Single Responsibility
2. Create proper abstractions to ensure Open-Closed Principle
3. Fix inheritance hierarchy to maintain Liskov Substitution
4. Define focused interfaces to satisfy Interface Segregation
5. Implement dependency injection to achieve Dependency Inversion

### Phase 3: Performance Optimizations
1. Identify performance bottlenecks through profiling
2. Implement multiprocessing for parallel file processing
3. Optimize data structures for memory efficiency
4. Implement caching for repeated operations
5. Add progress reporting through observer pattern

### Phase 4: Finalization and Testing
1. Create comprehensive test suite for new architecture
2. Validate performance improvements with benchmarks
3. Document new architecture and patterns
4. Create example code for extending the system
